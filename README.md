# Student Analytics Dashboard and Data Storage System

This project is an end-to-end application that tracks, stores, and analyzes student activity data from an LMS (e.g., Canvas). It includes a robust SQL backend, REST APIs for data handling, and an analytics dashboard to visualize both high-level course trends and granular, student-specific engagement data.

## **Features**
- **Backend:** SQL database for secure and scalable data storage.
- **REST API Layer:** CRUD operations to manage activity data efficiently.
- **Dashboard:** Interactive data visualization for faculty and admins.
- **Granular Insights:** Tracks data at both course and student levels, such as:
  - Time spent on modules, pages, and discussions
  - Individual student engagement and activity patterns
  - Comparative analysis across students and modules
- **Reporting:** Generates custom reports to support informed decision-making.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Backend:** Spring Boot (Java), RESTful APIs
- **Database:** SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQL Server)
- **Frontend:** React.js with data visualization (Chart.js, Recharts)
- **API Integration:** Canvas LMS REST API
- **Data Import/Export:** Supports bulk data operations via CSV or JSON
